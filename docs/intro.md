# Introduction

Welcome!

This is the documentation for the Team 3256 software team.

## A foreword

Software, like any subteam, has had the issue of maintaining knowledge through the years, and being unable to learn content outside of formal training that you can only get from experience.

This documentation is an attempt to solve that issue, given software's unique position of having to learn a lot of new content every year, and having to maintain that knowledge for years to come.

Many things in this documentation should not be taken as gospel, but rather as a starting point for your own research. This documentation is not a replacement for experience, but rather a supplement to it.

## What should go here?

Anything that you think is important to know, including content covered in formal training that you think could be expanded upon, or content that you think is important to know that isn't covered in formal training.

## How to contribute

This documentation is open source, and can be found [here](https://github.com/team3256/docs), and contributions are welcome.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the #software channel on the team Discord server.

If you have any questions about Docusaurus, see the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/), and the Docusaurus Help section in the sidebar.
